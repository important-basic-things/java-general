Which of the following statements are true?

> The primitive types `int`, `short`, `long` and `byte` are all signed integer types.

Correct. They are all signed integers.

> The length of the `int` type should at least *16-bit*.

Incorrect. The values of the integral types are integers in the following ranges:

* For `byte`, from `-128` to `127`, inclusive
* For `short`, from `-32768` to `32767`, inclusive
* For `int`, from `-2147483648` to `2147483647`, inclusive
* For `long`, from `-9223372036854775808` to `9223372036854775807`, inclusive

> The `byte` primitive type is an unsigned integer type range from `0` to `255`.

Incorrect. `byte` is a signed type.
