JVM specifies the length of each integer primitive type. So that there will all behave the same on different platforms. It is important to remember their length (either in *bit* or in *byte*.)

Which of the following statements are true?

1. The primitive types `int`, `short`, `long` and `byte` are all signed integer types.
2. The length of the `int` type should at least *16-bit*.
3. The `byte` primitive type is an unsigned integer type range from `0` to `255`.
