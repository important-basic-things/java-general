Usually, we will compile Java program in our IDE. But for some environment, we need to compile our code via command line. For example, in a container of CI pipeline. 

Now, you want to compile a single-file Java program called `Excel.java`. You entered the follow command:

```bash
$ java Excel.java
```

But it doesn't work. Why? Can you give the correct command?
