The output is:

```
true
false
```

This is because the `equals` method of string compares the contents while the `==` operator compares the instaces. 

Though it is true that the virtual machine aways arrange same **string literals** to be shared, strings generated by operators or `substring` are not shared. And the `==` operator compares whether 2 variable reference the same object.
