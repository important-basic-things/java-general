Java has three ways of marking comments. 

* The most common form is a `//`. Use this for a comment that runs from the `//` to the *end of the line*.
* When longer comments are needed, you can use the `/*` and `*/` comment delimiters that let you block off a longer comment.
* A third kind of comment can be used to generate documentation automatically. This comment uses a `/**` to start and a `*/` to end.
