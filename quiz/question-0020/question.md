In Java, we can define variables to help us better organize the source code. To make our source code understandable, we can give the variables meaningful names. But it does not mean that we can naming the variable whatever we want.

Which of the following names can be used as a variable name?

1. `teacher`
2. `teacher_1`
3. `_teacher_1`
4. `1_teacher`
5. `$teacher`
6. `+teacher`
7. `$-teacher`
