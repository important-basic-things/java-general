In `switch` statement, execution starts at the `case` label that matches the value on which the selection is performed and continues until the next `break` or the end of the switch. If none of the `case` labels match, then the `default` clause is executed, if it is present.

Technically, the final `break` is not required because flow falls out of the switch statement. But using a `break` is recommended so that modifying the code is easier and less error prone.
