If you would like to write multiple `if...else` clause, you can use `switch` to make your code easier to read. Given the following program. What is the output?

```java
String condition = "water";
switch (condition) {
  default:
    System.out.println("Not supported");
  case "water":
    System.out.println("Great");
}
```
