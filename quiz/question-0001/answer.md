Overall: The JDK is the software packs for programmers who want to write Java program. While the JRE is the software for consumers who want to run Java programs.

Checkpoint 1: The JRE is a package of software necessary to run a compiled Java program. Including the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), the Java Class Library, the `java` command, and other infrastructure. But it does not contains tools for creating and compiling Java programs.

Checkpoint 2: The JDK has everything the JRE has, but also the compiler (`javac`) and tools (like `javadoc` and `jdb`). So it is capable of creating and compiling Java programs.
