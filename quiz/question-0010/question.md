In Java, you must name your source code file correctly, or an syntax error will be generated.

If you have defined the following class:

```java
public class FirstGreeting {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello world");
  }
}
```

And you would like to save it into a file. What is the file name?
